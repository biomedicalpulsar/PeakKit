# PeakKit

PeakKit utilizes various algorithms to identify regional target genes, including those overlapping with promoters, overlapping with TSS, proximal, and closest target genes. The tool supports 11 species and 66 genome versions, covering common species such as homo sapiens, mus musculus, caenorhabditis elegans, and arabidopsis, and so on. To quickly respond to user needs, users only need to provide the genome version, and we will update the corresponding genomic data within one to two days. PeakKit organizes a rich set of signal annotations, allowing users to upload peak files and select the desired annotation types to obtain detailed annotation results for the regions. These annotations include over 2,000 biosamples, such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, super-enhancers, FANTOM5 promoters, and SNPs, significantly simplifying the data organization process and meeting the needs of diverse analyses. Additionally, PeakKit offers a web-based version of bedtools to facilitate one-stop peak processing, catering to users' diverse region processing needs, such as “sort”, “merge”, “intersect”, “subtract”, “multiinter”, “flank”, and other frequently used functions.
